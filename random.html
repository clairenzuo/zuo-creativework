        <p> I got really bored in <br>
          winter of 2020, so I decided<br>
          to design posters of songs that<br>
          I really enjoyed at the time.üåü<br>

       Still Striving<br>
       2017<br>
       I photoshopped two separate images of
       Nicki Minaj and ASAP Ferg together on a
      Yellow background, and added rip and crinkle
        textures. I had a lot of fun altering the typography
        for this poster. I did a lot of stretching of the text
      and broke its standard boundaries.</p>

        <img src="astro.png" alt="asaprocky"/>
        <p><span class="special-text" tabindex="0">BABUSHKA BOI - A$AP ROCKY</span></br>
           2019 <br>
          I used an image of A$AP that I found interesting. I centered all
        the color schemes of the poster around the photo. I focused on the orange and black colors
      using white as a highlighting color. I really liked the vertical text so I played
    around with that a lot. Being able to read it was still important to me, so I made sure to cut his name off
  at the right spot so that the gestault effect could fill in the rest.</p>
        <img src="bored.jpg" alt="bored"/>
        <p><span class="special-text" tabindex="0">BORED - BILLIE EILISH</span></br>
         13 Reasons Why<br>
         2017 <br>
        I loved that photo of Billie so I created the
        poster based off the image, focusing on green.
        Her goggles looked futuristic so I added a bubble
        wrap texture instead of the wrinkle texture I usually use. I matched the futuristic looked
      with digital styled text for the date. Since Bored and Billie both started with B, I thought
    it would be fun to have them start from the same point.</p>

          JACKBOYS<br>
          2019<br>
          *I don't support Travis anymore* I really liked this song at the time.
          Especially the outro instrumental felt
          like I was floating, so I focused on skies,
          clouds, and emphasized the color blue. I spliced in an image of travis with
        an astronaut. I made the background color gradient from blue to white to accentuate the feeliing
      of going upwards.</p>
          <img src="90210.jpg" alt="90210"/>
          <p><span class="special-text" tabindex="0">90210 - TRAVIS SCOTT</span></br>
           Rodeo (Expanded)<br>
           2015 <br>
           *I don't support Travis anymore* One of my favorite Travis Scott songs.
          Initially it was all black, but I
          went back and inverted part of the image.
          I added snippets of lyrics around the page. </p>
