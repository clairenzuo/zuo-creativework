          Problem: Proper budgeting is a common issue for post-secondary 
          students. It's often their first experience managing personal finances, 
          and students tend to overspend. Current budgeting apps are catered towards 
          working individuals with full-time jobs. They're usually complex and focused 
          on investing and credit score monitoring. This can prove to be a 
          difficult experience for students beginning their budgeting journey. <br>
          <br> 
          Solution: iBudget is an efficient and intuitive app. It's a way for a college student to manage 
          their expenses. They can also adjust future spending accordingly. It’s customizable so that 
          the user can cater the categories to their personal needs. And it's easy to understand and 
          is focused on more immediate spending.  <br>

        <p>
          In 2018 I had to do a design challenge. Here is the Prompt: Create an app to strengthen the school community. Your school wants an 
          experience that allows older students to connect with new students. The app should help the 
          new students adjust. Consider the sign up process and how mentors and mentees can connect with 
          each other through on-campus experiences.
